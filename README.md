# Jellyfin Refinned

*Refined version of the default Jellyfin skin.*

Some modifications to the default Jellyfin theme to make it feel more refined and emphasize the purple color over the blue (my personal preference).

*Instructions and more details to come.*

**Theme-wide features/improvements:**

- Pleasing rounded corners on everything
- Purple highlights throughout
- Minimal-height header with blurred background
- Translucent backgrounds throughout
- Dark, slightly blurred backgrounds to increase legibility
- No weird background glitches when scrolling quickly
- Includes images for media library items

**Home view features/improvements:**

- Clean "My Media" ribbon at top with no text labels for media libaries

**Movie/Episode/Album/Book view features/improvements:**

- Varying font sizes to improve visual hierarchy of details
- Blurred backgrounds behind episode/track listing for legibility
